  <h2>Exercise Explanations: </h2>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>All three functions/methods point to the window object.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Here I created a class Person, and assigned the properties name and age to it. I created a greet() method which would take the name and age properties and log the greeting to the console. I then created two new instances of the class Person and logged the greeting method</li>
    <br>
    <li>I did the same thing as exercise 2, where the constructor accepts and initializes the name and age properties.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I added an info() static method to the Person class and then called that method and logged it to the console.</li>
    <br>
    <li>So first I added a getter called personAge() and a setter called posAge() to the Person class. The getter would return back the age of the Person and the setter would set a new age for the Person. Wrote an IF statement within the setter to ensure that the number being input was not a negative number. Inputting a negative number would log an error to the console.</li>
    <br>
    <li>On exercise </li>
    <br>
    <li>I created two classes. First I created the Book class, which contained a private property #isbn, and a constructor with properties isbn, title, author, and yearPublished. In the library class, in the constructor, I just return a books array, create methods for addBook, removeBook, and listBooks.</li>
