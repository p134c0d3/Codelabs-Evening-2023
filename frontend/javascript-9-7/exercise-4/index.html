		<h1>Exercise 4</h1>

		<h2 style="margin: 25px">Answer:</h2>

		<p style="margin: 50px">
			First I declared a variable myName and set to 'John'. I then created a function and modified the value of that variable within the function. Since it's a global variable I had access to it within the function and was able to reassign the value to 'Tiffany'. I then created another function and declared the variable myName and set it to 'Jethro'. I was able to do this because the scope was within the function, and while myName was declared globally, it wasn't declared within that function.
		</p>
		<script>
			let myName = "John";
      console.log(myName);
			// Declare a global variable here

			function modifyGlobal() {
        myName = "Tiffany"
        console.log(myName);
				// Try to modify the global variable here
			}

			function localScopeTest() {
        let myName = "Jethro";
        console.log(myName);
				// Declare a local variable with the same name as the global variable
			}


      modifyGlobal();
      localScopeTest();

			// Call both functions here
		</script>
