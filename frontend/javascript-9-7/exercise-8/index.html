			I created a function, and set a variable 'counter' to 0 within that function. I then created another function (inner) that incremented that variables value until it reached the value of 10, and then the value was reset to 0. I then returned that inner function to the outer function.

		<script>
			function setCounter() {
        let counter = 0;

        function returnedCounter() {
          while (counter < 9) {
            counter++;
            console.log(counter);
            // return counter
          } 
          if (counter = 10) {
            counter = 0
          }
          
        }
        return returnedCounter();
      }


      setCounter();
