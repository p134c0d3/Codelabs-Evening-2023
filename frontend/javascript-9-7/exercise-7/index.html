		<h1>Exercise 7</h1>

		<h2 style="margin: 25px">Answer:</h2>

		<p style="margin: 50px">
			So I created a function and defined a variable in it called countNum, and set the value = 1. I then created another function as the inner function and took that variable and set it to increment up. I returned that number and then returned the inner function. I called the outer	 function which showed the number that I set countNum to with + 1 added to it.
		</p>
		<script>
			function setupCounter() {
    // Define a count variable here
		let count = 0;

    return function() {
        // Increment and print the count
				count++;
				console.log(count);
    }
}

// Create a counter instance and invoke it to test

let myVar = setupCounter();
myVar();
myVar();
myVar();
myVar();
myVar();
myVar();
myVar();
myVar();
myVar();
